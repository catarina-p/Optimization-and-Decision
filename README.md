# Optimization and Decision
This project consists of the implementation of a Genetic Algorithm to solve a Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem.
Files:
- 3 .txt documents consisting of 3 intances of the CVRP (small, medium and large)
- GA_CVRP.py : Genetic Algorithm implementation in python
- RegExService.py : reads and loads the data from the .txt files (source: https://github.com/pkonowrocki/CVRP_ACO)
- Relatorio 90230.pdf : Report for the project (written in Portuguese)
